virtual Function:
A virtual function is written in the base class so that the functon defined as virtual can be overidden in deried classes.
When we need to overwrite the function of an object using a reference used in base class to run the derived class version of it.


Polymorphism:
polymorphism is of two types when it is meant for c++.These are compile time running and runtime running:
Compile time running mean the program sets the results while compiling such as fuction overloading and operator overloading.
runtime running meansfunction overiding.when a derived class function is derived from base class and overridden.
